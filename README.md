# My eBay Clone

## Tech

Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Blockchain e-commerce using Thirdweb.com

## Short Summary

This example shows how I created an eBay Clone using Blockchain for authentication for inventory management, bidding and selling NFTs on real Etherium Network. I made it by watching a YouTube video LoL :) And it works. If you are also curious about what the heck is thirdweb and blockchain and how those work in a modern web application you can clone this and follow along either on YouTube or with me.

## Deployment

I deployed the app using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/. You can preview live here [Jetkin-eBay](https://ebay-clone-youtube-cagdasyetkin.vercel.app/)

## How to use

Clone this repo and run `npm install`. It will install all the dependencies. Then go ahead and run `npm run dev` and it will fire up your local host.

To experience the blockchain aspect have you wallet ready in your browser extention. Something like Metamask.

The app is using `Goerli Etherium Network` currency `GOR`. You can use _Add to Inventory_ button to add NFTs into your NFT inventory. And then click on _List Item_ button to list them on the website for sale.

If you connect your wallet to my deployed version you can see a list of my NFTs that I am selling. They are some sample art-works created by DALL-E (my account LOL).

All the listings and the marketplace managed by [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/). Lots of functions in this app developed by those people and I simply imported and used them.

This project is a very different experience then having your own database and virtual machine. Vercel magically deploys the app and thirdweb manages and database. They are abstracted away from you.

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions.
